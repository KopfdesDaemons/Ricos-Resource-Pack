# Ricos Resource Pack

My resource pack is designed to make Minecraft more **colorful**. The colors are **vibrant** and **bright**. The textures are **very clean**. A **simple look** is maintained. The resource pack only changes essential blocks that are crucial to my desired appearance. Many textures retain their original, vanilla look, simply refined.
